//The following HTML routes should be created:

// `GET /notes` should return the `notes.html` file.

// `GET *` should return the `index.html` file.

// `DELETE /api/notes/:id` should receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
